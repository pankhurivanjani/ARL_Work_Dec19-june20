**Micro-ROS**

* ROS2 for microcontrollers

* Uses Real time operating system (RTOS) instead of LInux

* DDS for eXtremely Resource Constrained Environments (DDS-XRCE) instead of classical DDS

**Concepts: Middleware**

* [Detailed Information about Micro XRCE-DDS](https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/concepts/middleware/Micro_XRCE-DDS/)

**Concepts: RTOS**

 micro-ROS integrates RTOS in its software stack taking advantage of RTOS capabilities [Why a Real-Time Operating System?
](https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/concepts/rtos/)

3 major RTOS available for Micro-ros

1. [FreeRTOS](https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/concepts/rtos/FreeRTOS/)

2. [NuttX](https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/concepts/rtos/NuttX/)

3. [Zephyr](https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/concepts/rtos/Zephyr/)

[Comparison of these 3 RTOS](https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/concepts/rtos/comparison/)
 
**Tutorials and Experiments**

* OS Using: ROS2 Dashing

* [Work with Embedded board](https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/tutorials/core/getting_started_embedded/): 

    * Built Docker Image
    
    * Flashed the image on STM32-E407 board
    
* Work with QEMU Simulator(generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer) [https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/tutorials/core/getting_started_simulator/]

* [Programming client/service with rcl](https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/tutorials/core/programming_rcl_rclc/)

* [RMW & Micro XRCE-DDS Configuration](https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/tutorials/core/microxrcedds_rmw_configuration/)

Since micro-ROS is intended to work on extremely low resources systems, its middleware layer is highly configurable. This configurability, along with the fact that the middleware layer does not use dynamic memory, allows the users to determine how much static memory is going to be allocated.

**Demos**

1. Kobuki Demo:

* Instead of a laptop running ROS, the Kobuki is equipped with a STM32F4 microcontroller only. This STM32F4 runs the micro-ROS stack and a port of the thin_kobuki driver, which interacts with the robotâ€™s firmware (which runs on a built-in microcontroller)

* The STM32F4 communicates the sensor data via DDS-XRCE to a remote laptop running a standard ROS 2 stack, the micro-ROS agent and rviz. 

* At the same time, using the other direction of communication, the Kobuki can be remote-controlled.

2. [Crazyfly demo](https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/tutorials/demos/crazyflie_demo/)
