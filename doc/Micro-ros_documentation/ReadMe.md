**Micro-ROS**

* ROS2 for microcontrollers

* Uses Real time operating system (RTOS) instead of LInux

* DDS for eXtremely Resource Constrained Environments (DDS-XRCE) instead of classical DDS

**Concepts associated with Mirco-ros: Client library**

* Introduction to Client Library [Introduction to Client Library](https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/concepts/client_library/)

* [Real-Time Executor](https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/concepts/client_library/real-time_executor/)

    ** Architecture

    ** Scheduling Semantics

    ** Real-time embedded application used-case

*Must read exammples for robotics application*

    * Sense-plan-act pipeline in robotics

    * Synchronization of multiple rates (related to sensor fusion)

    * High-priority processing path

** [Lifecycle and System Modes](https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/concepts/client_library/system_modes/)

**Concepts: Middleware**

* [Detailed Information about Micro XRCE-DDS](https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/concepts/middleware/Micro_XRCE-DDS/)

**Concepts: RTOS**

 micro-ROS integrates RTOS in its software stack taking advantage of RTOS capabilities [Why a Real-Time Operating System?
](https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/concepts/rtos/)

3 major RTOS available for Micro-ros

1. [FreeRTOS](https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/concepts/rtos/FreeRTOS/)

2. [NuttX](https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/concepts/rtos/NuttX/)

3. [Zephyr](https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/concepts/rtos/Zephyr/)
